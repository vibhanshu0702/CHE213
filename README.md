## Objective
This project investigates the separation of ethanol-water azeotropic mixtures using both simple and azeotropic distillation techniques. The focus is on evaluating the effect of glycerol as a non-volatile entrainer to break the azeotrope and improve ethanol recovery.

## Problem Overview
Azeotropes are mixtures that boil at a constant temperature with the same composition in both vapor and liquid phases, making separation via conventional distillation impossible. Ethanol and water form a minimum-boiling azeotrope at approximately 95.6% ethanol. The goal of this project is to overcome this limitation using glycerol as a separating agent.

## Experimental Setup
- **Boiling Flask:** Holds ethanol-water mixture.
- **Distillation Column:** Facilitates partial separation.
- **Thermometer:** Monitors vapor temperature.
- **Condenser:** Cools and condenses vapor using circulating water.
- **Receiver Flask:** Collects distillate.
- **Glycerol Addition:** 60 mL glycerol added per 100 mL feed for azeotropic distillation.
- **Cooling System:** Maintains condenser temperature.
- **Refractometer:** Measures refractive index for ethanol concentration.

## Innovation Aspect
The innovation lies in using glycerol, a high-boiling, non-toxic, and reusable entrainer, to shift the vapor-liquid equilibrium. This allows ethanol to be distilled beyond the azeotropic limit using conventional lab-scale equipment, making the method safer and more sustainable than alternatives using volatile entrainers.

## Methodology
1. Prepare mixtures with and without glycerol.
2. Heat the boiling flask and stabilize temperature readings.
3. Take samples from top and bottom every 3 minutes.
4. Measure refractive index of samples to estimate ethanol concentration.
5. Repeat for varying ethanol-water compositions:
   - Without glycerol: A (98:2), B (89.5:10.5), C (50:50), D (25:75) % EtOH:H2O
   - With glycerol: Same compositions + 60 mL glycerol

## Theory
Azeotropic distillation with glycerol leverages its strong interaction with water to suppress waterâ€™s volatility. This alters the vapor-liquid equilibrium, enabling ethanol enrichment beyond 95.6%. Glycerol remains in the flask due to its high boiling point and can be reused.

## Results
- **Calibration:** Linear relationship used for ethanol-water RI, polynomial fit for glycerol mixtures.
- **T-x-y plots:** Modeled using quadratic fits for both systems.
- **Separation:** Some improvement in ethanol recovery with glycerol observed, though limitations existed due to measurement errors and setup constraints.

## Key Observations and Analysis
- Negative volume readings likely due to:
  - Manual errors
  - Vapor losses
  - Poor mixing
  - Heating inconsistencies
- Sample ethanol mole fractions were consistently around -0.485 due to lack of accurate calibration data and possible RI interpretation issues.
- Glycerol improved separation behavior but did not achieve theoretical expectations due to equipment limitations.

## Conclusion
The glycerol-assisted method demonstrated potential but suffered from experimental challenges. Improved calibration and setup could significantly enhance separation efficiency.

## Future Work
- Develop a reliable refractive index vs. ethanol concentration calibration curve.
- Ensure thorough mixing of feed and glycerol.
- Use more accurate measurement techniques.
- Upgrade to fractional distillation column.
- Implement better insulation and vapor recovery.
